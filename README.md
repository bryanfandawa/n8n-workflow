# üìñ n8n Sermon Automation Workflow

This repository showcases my development of an AI-powered automation workflow designed to assist churches in creating content from sermon audio files. The workflow utilizes **n8n** (self-hosted using Docker and a virtual machine) and **ChatGPT** to streamline the process of generating blog posts, transcripts, and social media content.

## üß† Overview

The core idea is to automate the process of turning sermons into digital content:

1. **Audio Processing**: Sermon audio files are cut into chunks and compressed.
2. **Transcription**: The audio chunks are sent to a transcription service.
3. **AI Integration**: Transcripts are sent to ChatGPT to generate summaries, blog posts, and social media posts.
4. **Content Publishing**: Posts are automatically published to WordPress and other platforms.
